This git_hooks directory was created so that hook scripts can be placed in the repository.

By default, git hooks are in the directory .git/hooks, and the .git directory is excluded from the repository.

To configure git to use this directory for hooks, run this command from the repository root directory:
$ git config --local core.hooksPath .git_hooks

That command will add or modify .git/config.
